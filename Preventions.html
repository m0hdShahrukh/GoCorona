            Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local health authority. <br> To prevent the spread of COVID-19: <br> <br>◉ Clean your hands often. Use soap and
            water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. <br>◉ Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. <br>◉ Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible. <br>◉ Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. <br>◉ Cover your nose and
            mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. <br>◉ Stay home if you feel unwell. <br>◉ If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. <br> <br> <br> Calling in advance allows your healthcare
            provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections. <br><br> Masks <br><br> Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask
            to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
