        <h1 class="h2">What is COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID
            conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain
            underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">What is community spread?</h1>
        <p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information
            on community spread in your area, please visit your local health department's website.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">How does the virus spread?</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to
            others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes. COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads
            from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people. For more information about
            how COVID-19 spreads, visit the How COVID-19 Spreads page to learn how COVID-19 spreads and how to protect yourself.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated
            as COVID-19. In COVID-19, “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, and ”D” for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?</h1>
        <p>Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it
            may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Learn more
            about safe handling of deliveries and mail.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>Yes. CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people. When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one. A mask
            is NOT a substitute for social distancing. Masks should still be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when indoors around people who don't live in your household. Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes,
            buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. While masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19,
            CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?</h1>
        <p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">How can I protect myself?</h1>
        <p>Visit the How to Protect Yourself & Others page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?</h1>
        <p>Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you. Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and
            non-prescription medications. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations and other preventative services are up to date. Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if you
            get sick. to find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other conditions. If you must visit in-person, protect yourself and others. Do not delay getting emergency care for
            your health problems or any underlying medical condition that requires immediate attention.</p>
        <h1 class="h2">Is it okay for me to donate blood?</h1>
        <p>In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who
            are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these
            recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.</p>
